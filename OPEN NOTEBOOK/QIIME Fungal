QIIME Fungal

ITS evolution about x1000 faster
Evolves differently in different lin
non coding, transcribe, but spliced out
maintanecne to 2nd structure
Indel evolution -> can align within a family
Indels mess up alignment

18S SSU -> ITS1 -> 5.8 -> ITS2 -> LSU

454 target ITS1 
(ITS1F and ITS2) don't use

ITS1F 30 bp up from end of 18S SSU
ITS4 sits in the LSU

In the SSU, intron splice site, near the end. It comes and go.
